Dataset Description:

Fordgobike is a dataset with 174952 and 22 features (duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude ,end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip,start_date,start_day,start_month,start_year,duration_min,member_age). Most variables are 11 numerical, and others are 1 datetime, 10 object type after preprocessing.
The new features that I have made before such as member age and duration in minute will help me in the analysis process.

Summary of Findings:

1-We can conclude that Thursday of February month is the suitable date for going on a trip.
2-The percentage of the subscribers is higher than the percentage of the customers.
2-we notice that the age varies from the range 20 and 45 years old for all users whatever they are subscribers or customers that are the most frequent(Young people).
3-The users who do not make bike_share_for_all_trip takes little higher duration than who make bike_share_for_all_trip .
4-The customers have large duration trip within days than the subscribers
5-The Subscribers are almost consistent through all weekdays

key insights:

1- we used univariate visualization such as histogram to show the frequency of the features like, weekdays and age of users.

2- we used bivariate visualization such as violinplot and scatter plot to show the relation between two features such as Trip duration and the age.

3- we used multivariate visualization such as catplot to show the relation between three features like,Trip duration of weekdays for user type.
