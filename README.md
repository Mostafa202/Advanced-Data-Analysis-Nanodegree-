The Data Analysis Process
Learn about the data analysis process and practice
investigating different datasets using Python and its powerful
packages for data analysis.
Data Analysis Process - Case Study
Investigate a more challenging dataset on fuel economy and
learn more about problems and strategies in data analysis.
Continue to build on your Python for data analysis skills.
Programming Workflow for Data Analysis
Additional content to expose you to a different workflow for
your analysis in Python: IPython's command line interface,
writing scripts in text editors, running scripts in the terminal
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Descriptive Statistics - Part I
In this lesson, you will learn about data types, measures of
center, and the basics of statistical notation.
Descriptive Statistics - Part II
In this lesson, you will learn about measures of spread, shape,
and outliers as associated with quantitative data. You will also
get a first look at inferential statistics.
Admissions Case Study
Learn to ask the right questions, as you learn about Simpson's
Paradox.
Probability Gain the basics of probability using coins and die.
Binomial Distribution
Learn about one of the most popular distributions in
probability - the Binomial Distribution.
Conditional Probability
Not all events are independent. Learn the probability rules for
dependent events.
Bayes Rule
Learn one of the most popular rules in all of statistics - Bayes
rule.
Python Probability Practice
Take what you have learned in the last lessons and put it to
practice in Python.
Normal Distribution Theory
Learn the mathematics behind moving from a coin flip to a
normal distribution.
Sampling distributions and the Central
Limit Theorem
Learn all about the underpinning of confidence intervals and
hypothesis testing - sampling distributions.
Confidence Intervals
Learn how to use sampling distributions and bootstrapping to
create a confidence interval for any parameter of interest.
Hypothesis Testing
Learn the necessary skills to create and analyze the results in
hypothesis testing.
Case Study: A/B tests
Work through a case study of how A/B testing works for an
online education company called Audacity.
Regression
Use python to fit linear regression models, as well as
understand how to interpret the results of linear models.
Multiple Linear Regression
Learn to apply multiple linear regression models in python.
Learn to interpret the results and understand if your model fits
well.
Logistic Regression
Learn to apply logistic regression models in python. Learn to
interpret the results and understand if your model fits well
---------------------------------------------------------------

Data Visualization in Data Analysis
In this lesson, see the motivations for why data visualization is
an important part of the data analysis process and where it fits
in.
Design of Visualizations
Learn about elements of visualization design, especially to
avoid those elements that can cause a visualization to fail.
Univariate Exploration of Data
In this lesson, you will see how you can use matplotlib and
seaborn to produce informative visualizations of single
variables.
Bivariate Exploration of Data
In this lesson, build up from your understanding of individual
variables and learn how to use matplotlib and seaborn to look
at relationships between two variables.
Multivariate Exploration of Data
In this lesson, see how you can use matplotlib and seaborn to
visualize relationships and interactions between three or more
variables.
Explanatory Visualizations
Previous lessons covered how you could use visualizations to
learn about your data. In this lesson, see how to polish up
those plots to convey your findings to others!
Visualization Case Study
Put to practice the concepts you've learned about exploratory
and explanatory data visualization in this case study on factors
that impact diamond prices.
